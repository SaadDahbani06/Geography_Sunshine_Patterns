How to push to GitHub (replace <URL>):

    git remote add origin <URL>
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main

Notes:
- .gitignore excludes common caches and large data under `data/` by default. Remove `data/` from .gitignore if you want to track small datasets.
- If you want, I can also add a .gitattributes to help notebook diffs or set up GitHub Actions / pre-commit hooks.
